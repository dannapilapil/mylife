            <h2>Interstellar</h2>
            <p>
              Interstellar has such an amazing and thorough plot.<br /> The casting for this movie was really well put together.<br /> Also, the animation and special effects of this movie was very creative and breathtaking.<br /> I really recommend to see this movie if you haven't.

            <h2>The Martian</h2>
            <p>
            	The Martian is a very interesting and well thought out movie.<br /> Some of the cast were actually from Interstellar and they also played the roles of astronauts.<br /> The plot line for this movie was remarkable and very eye-opening.<br /> This movie is a must see if you haven't yet.

            <h2>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</h2>
            <p>
            	Star Wars: The Force Awakens is such a thrilling and exciting movie.<br /> It is part of the epic space film series created by George Lucas.<br /> The movie has an amazing soundtrack. <br />Featuring the theme song of the film; which gives me goosebumps when I hear it. <br />This movie has everything a movie needs. <br />You have to see this movie-even if you haven't seen the other ones.
