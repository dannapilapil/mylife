 		<h2>Pasta</h2>
 		<p>
 			Pasta is my first favorite food. <br /> It is so good and there are many different kinds of pastas. <br />Some of my top three favorites are <br />Carbonara, Spaghetti and Oil Base. <br />Pasta is so good and if you haven't eaten it before <br />you have to! Since you are missing out.

 		<h2>Ribs</h2>
 		<p>
 		Ribs are my second favorite food.<br /> Most times I would eat it without any sauce<br /> but when I do, I pair it with bbq sauce.<br /> My favorite ribs are the ones that my mom makes.<br /> There's just something that makes it taste <br />better than all the other ribs I have eaten in my life.<br /> Ribs are really good and if you haven't eaten it<br /> you are missing out (again).

 		<h2>Baked Sushi</h2>
 		<p>
 		Baked Sushi is my third favorite food.<br /> My mom makes these and of course they are my favorite.<br /> I don't like sushi that much but the way my <br />mom makes the baked sushi has changed that.<br /> It's so tasty and it has that flavor that<br /> makes me feel warm and good inside.<br />
