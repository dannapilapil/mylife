 		<h2>The Flash</h2>
 		<p>
 		The Flash is such an awesome and exciting show.<br /> It's about the fastest man on earth and his purpose is to <br />protect people from the meta-humans (people who have powers). <br />As Barry Allen continues to save people he learns new things and becomes faster. <br />This show is part of the DC Comics and is pretty interesting every time I watch it.

 		<h2>Arrow</h2>
 		<p>
 		Arrow is such a thrilling and action-packed show.<br /> In my opinion, Arrow is better than the Flash.<br /> Arrow is more serious and sophisticated.<br /> Oliver Queen has been through some really tough times and<br /> during those times he had to do things that he truly regret. <br />Now that he is back home he is a changed person and protects his city from criminals. <br /> This show is also part of the DC Comics universe.

 		<h2>How To Get Away With Murder</h2>
 		<p>
 		How To Get Away With Murder is such a suspenseful and mind twisting show. <br /> Annalise Keating is a professor of defense law and teaches <br />a class called How to Get Away With Murder.<br /> She is also a criminal defense attorney, and she selects a group of students.<br />The students Annalise picked are very bright and they are the best.<br />They are there to assist with the cases at Annalise's firm. <br />The show is full of surprises and twists. It is a must see!
